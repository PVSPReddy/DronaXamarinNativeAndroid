In this example we are creating a page that converts the respective words in to 
respective numbers based on basic mobile key-pad and also shows previous translated histories.

Here we also learn the way to navigate to different pages unlike the previous example in which 
we only stay in single page.

Here we also learns how to get string values form Strings.xml which lies in
Resources/Values/Strings.xml folders. for Page Title we are giving the name from this
Strings.xml page as "Translation History".

This the back end code lies in main activity, HelloAndroidMultiScreen folder, we are using the PhoneWordTranslatorSingleScreeen.cs
from HelloAndroidSingleScreen folder and UI part is designed in the layouts folder named as  HelloAndroidMultiScreenAXML.
