Here we are now working with fragments


Fragments can be simply defined as piece of code, which can hold UI and logic in them similar to an activity
which can be used by the activities, by this the code is shared among fragments so teh preformance will be increased and the time
taking to load will be very less when compared to load an activity

An activity can hold any number of fragments
and every fragment can be used by any number of activities.



here there is another use for a fragment when we are using similar app in both tabs and mobile devices
In mobile menu is in one activity and its details is kept in another activity
when comes to tablet, both of them have to be shown in single activity side by side

so if we have toachieve this we have to create differently fo bothe the devices
but by using fragments we can simply use two fragments with menu in one and details in another
then 
if the device is mobile we show them in different times(onclick)
and in tabs we can simply show them at same time.


here i have created another layout folder "layout-large" in resource folder
layout folder is for mobiles and 
layout-large if for tablets

created same file in both the folders
"FragmentSampleOneAXML.axml"

add this line for fragment after "<fragment"
class="com.xamarin.sample.fragments.supportlib.TitlesFragment"


and also created fragments with same name
titlesFragmentOne

but in layout-large->FragmentSampleOneAXML.axml
we created another extra layout to hold the details also

Note
Note
******************
while creating fragment in layout you have to create a Fragment class in cs files (how to create is described below)
this has to be referenced in the layout that you created as like this

<fragment
        class="FragmentSamples.Views.FragmentSampleOne.TitlesFragment"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:id="@+id/titlesFragmentOne" />

or as

<fragment
        android:name="FragmentSamples.Views.FragmentSampleOne.TitlesFragment"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:id="@+id/titlesFragmentOne" />

using class attribute or android:name attribute

here you are refering the TitlesFragment class which is inheriting Android.App.Fragment similar to some classes inheriting Activity

here to refer this we have to use the namespace and the folder structure of the class

FragmentSamples:    is my app name or  namespace of the project
Views:              In this application root I created a folder for Views
FragmentSampleOne:  In Views folder i have created another folder called FragmentSampleOne folder
TitlesFragment:     In FragmentSampleOne folder I created a class(TitlesFragment) file that inherits Android.App.Fragment class

this is why i gave the class value in fragment as "FragmentSamples.Views.FragmentSampleOne.TitlesFragment"

*******************


now we have to create a fragment 
select folder then right click select on add file, now select/create fragment with name "TitlesFragment"
click ok.

now this class inherits the Fragment class ,
change that to Android.App.ListFragment.

also create an activity to hold these fragments
create FragmentSampleOneActivity.cs





For Tablet

We create 
    a) TitlesFragment.cs , this inherits Android.App.ListFragment Class
    b) DetailsFragment.cs , this inherits Android.App.Fragment Class
    c) FragmentSampleOneAXML.axml layout
    e) FragmentSampleOneActivity.cs, this inherits Activity
    d) Shakespear.cs , this contains data to populate the DetailsFragment.cs

here Titlesfragment.cs is a fragment that holds the list data
on selecting a value if has a previous DetailsFragment it removes and creates a new one else it directly creates a new one
on another value selection it does the same process
fragmentSampleOneAXML.axml is a ui component that has a fragment and a framelayout this framelayout is the details layout which later acts as a fragment in DetailsFragment.cs
FragmentSampleOneActivity.cs is the activity that holds both Fragments in single screen



For Mobiles

We create 
    a) TitlesFragment.cs , this inherits Android.App.ListFragment Class
    b) DetailsFragment.cs , this inherits Android.App.Fragment Class
    c) FragmentSampleOneAXML.axml layout
    d) FragmentSampleOneActivity.cs, this inherits Activity
    e) DetailsActivity.cs, this inherits Activity
    f) Shakespear.cs , this contains data to populate the DetailsFragment.cs

here Titlesfragment.cs is a fragment that holds the list data
on selecting a value if has a previous DetailsFragment it removes and creates a new one else it directly creates a new one
on another value selection it does the same process
fragmentSampleOneAXML.axml is a ui component that has a fragment and a framelayout this framelayout is the details layout which later acts as a fragment in DetailsFragment.cs
FragmentSampleOneActivity.cs is the activity that holds items list Fragment
 DetailsActivity.cs is another activity that holds detais with/with-out any fragment
